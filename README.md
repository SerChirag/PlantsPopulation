# PlantsPopulation
A C program that simulates the natural competition between two species

This project was undertaken as a final assesment in the 1st Semester.
The program starts by assuming some initial positions for indivisuals of each species.
As simulation runs, the demographic data is displayed.

If the ecosystem is stable, the population reaches an equilibirum value and oscillates around it.
Finally, at the end of the simulation remarks on the viability of this particular eco-system.
